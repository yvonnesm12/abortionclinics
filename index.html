        <p>New York, NY — One third of the total abortion clinics in the U.S. are found in California and New York, while a handful of states have only one abortion clinic, according to 2017 data from the Guttmacher Instittue.</p>

<p>California and New York have a combined 274 abortion clinics in the state while Kentucky, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Mississippi each have one abortion clinic. The amount of abortion clinics in each state has likely changed over the last four years due to the increase of abortion restrictions passed in state legislations. In 2021, states enacted more than 100 abortion restrictions this year making it <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-10-05/states-enact-record-number-of-abortion-restrictions-in-2021">the worst year for abortion access on record.</a> </p>

          <p>Mississippi's only abortion clinic Jackson Women’s Health Organization is at <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/11/supreme-court-case-overturn-roe-v-wade/">the center of a Supreme Court case</a>
 that could determine the fate of abortion access across the country. SCOTUS heard oral arguments on December 1 to weigh in on Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. The case is directly at odds with <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the 1973 decision that established the right to an abortion up until 24 weeks. </p>

          <p>Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder and Executive Director of <a href="https://www.msreprofreedomfund.org/">the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund</a>, says the consequences of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> falling will be especially detrimental to the South, Midwest, and fly-over states. It’s estimated <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why">26 states would ban or likely ban abortion</a> if <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is overturned. </p>

          <p>“I have no other way to say it except for it would be a total blackout of legal access [to abortion] in almost half the country,” Roberts said. </p>

          <p>The Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund provides financial support to people seeking abortions. Roberts says many of their clients have to go to neighboring states like Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee to get an abortion because the Jackson clinic is farther away. </p>

          <p>“We already know the majority of Mississippians go out of state but they go to neighboring states,” Roberts said. “What happens when the only neighboring states that are providing abortions are Illinois?”</p>

          <p>People will most likely resort to dangerous methods, including using bleach and turpentine, to terminate a pregnancy, Roberts says.</p>

          <p>“What's going to change with the landscape is that you're gonna have people having to travel a whole lot further. That's gonna cost a whole lot more. The other thing is you're gonna have a lot, a lot of people self-managing their abortions, likely by buying pills online.” </p>
